I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- (to the waitress that brought her coffee)Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'.

Y'know, I shouldn't've, uh, asked you to start off with a monkey. I should've started you off with like a pen or a pencil.ScenesRachel: (Tearfully) Ross, I'm doing everything that I can, I've got everybody looking for him, and I- (Door buzzer goes and she runs to get it) Oh!

We checked the third and fourth floor, no-one's seen Marcel.ScenesLuisa: Marcel?ScenesRoss: My uncle Marcel.ScenesPhoebe: Oh, is that who the monkey's named after?ScenesLuisa: Oookay. Are you aware that possession of an illegal exotic is, uh, punishable by up to two years in prison and confiscation of the animal?ScenesPhoebe: Oh my God. You'd put that poor little creature in jail?ScenesMonica: Pheebs, you remember how we talked about saying things quietly to yourself first?ScenesPhoebe: Yes, but there isn't always time!ScenesMonica: Look.

And they're very hot.ScenesJoey: We can't, alright? (To the women) We're sorry. You have no idea how sorry, but... We promised we'd find this monkey. If you see him, he's about yea high and answers to the name Marcel, so if we could get some pictures of you, you'd really be helping us out.Scenes(The women quickly shut the door)ScenesChandler: Okay, from now on, you don't get to talk to other people.ScenesJoey: Marcel?ScenesChandler: Marcel?!Scenes[Cut to Monica and Phoebe searching the basement.]ScenesPhoebe: Marcel?ScenesMonica: Marcel?ScenesPhoebe: Marcel?ScenesBoth: Marcel?ScenesPhoebe: Oh-my-God!ScenesMonica: Whaaat!ScenesPhoebe: Something just brushed up against my right leg!ScenesMonica: What is it?ScenesPhoebe: Oh, it's okay, it was just my left leg.Scenes(Marcel makes a monkeyish noise.

Monica goes to check up on Phoebe) Are you okay?ScenesPhoebe: Yeah, think so. Oh! (She notices the tranquiliser dart has hit her in the butt and removes it) Huh.

Then cut to Ross and Rachel on the street outside.]ScenesRoss: Marcel?ScenesRachel: Marcel?ScenesRoss: Marc- oh, this is ridiculous! We've been all over the neighbourhood. He's gone, he's-he's just gone.ScenesRachel: Ross, you don't know that.ScenesRoss: Oh come on. It's cold, it's dark, he doesn't know the Village.

What do you want me to do? You want me to break my foot too? Okay, I'm gonna break my foot, right here. (Kicks the sign) Ow!! Oh! Oh my God, oh my God! There, are you happy now?!ScenesRoss: Yeah, yeah. Y'know, now that you kicked the sign, hey! I don't miss Marcel any more!ScenesRachel: Y'know, it is not like I did this on purpose.ScenesRoss: Oh, no no no. Nono, this is just vintage Rachel. I mean, things just sort of happen around you. I mean, you're off in Rachel-land, doing your Rachel-thing, totally oblivious to people's monkeys, or to people's feelings...ScenesRachel: Ross.ScenesRoss: I don't even wanna hear it, you're just...ScenesRachel: Ross.ScenesRoss: Oh, forget it, okay?ScenesRachel: Ross!ScenesRoss: What? What?Scenes(A man carrying a box of bananas walks past them. They stare for a minute and then hobble after him)ScenesBoth: Hey! Hey, Bananaman!Scenes(Scene 4: Everyone in the hall outside Mr. Heckles' door. Ross is carrying the box of bananas. He bangs on the door)ScenesPhoebe: Oh, this is so intense.

Marcel? Okay, where is he? Where is he? Marcel? Marcel?Scenes(Marcel jumps into view wearing a pink dress. Everybody gasps)ScenesRoss: Marcel! What've you done to him?ScenesMr. Heckles: That's my monkey. That's Patti, Patti the monkey.ScenesRoss: Are you insane? C'mere, Marcel, c'mon. (Marcel starts to go to him)ScenesMr. Heckles: C'mere, Patti. (Marcel turns round)ScenesRoss: C'mere, Marcel. (Turns to Ross)ScenesMr. Heckles: C'mere, Patti. (Turns to Mr. Heckles)ScenesLuisa: (Out of shot) Here, monkey. Here, monkey! Here, monkey! (Marcel runs to the door and into Luisa's cage, which she slams shut) Gotcha.ScenesRoss: Okay, gimme my monkey back.ScenesMr. Heckles: That's my monkey.ScenesLuisa: You're both gonna have to take this up with the judge.ScenesMr. Heckles: That's not my monkey. Just the dress is mine, you can send that back whenever.ScenesRoss: Alright, I want my monkey.ScenesLuisa: No!ScenesRachel: Oh, c'mon, Luisa!ScenesLuisa: Sorry, prom queen.ScenesRoss: (To Rachel) You had to be a bitch in high school, you couldn't've been fat.ScenesRachel: Alright. In high school I was the prom queen and I was the homecoming queen and the class president and you... were also there! But if you take this monkey, I will lose one of the most important people in my life. You can hate me if you want, but please do not punish him. C'mon, Luisa, you have a chance to be the bigger person here! Take it!ScenesLuisa: Nope.ScenesRachel: Alright. Well then how about I call your supervisor, and I tell her that you shot my friend in the ass with a dart?"
