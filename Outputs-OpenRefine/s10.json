I could just...ScenesRoss: No, NO! (they're moving to the side of the bed, where they sit down) Look, I need to talk to Joey. I mean, you guys just broke up.

(walks to Phoebe)ScenesChandler: (caresses the wall with his finger) Bye!ScenesRoss: Okay, uhm... Hey, you guys seen Joey anywhere?ScenesChandler: He's probably in his room with his current girlfriend Charlie. That's the situation as we know it... (walks to Phoebe and Monica)ScenesRoss: Well, if you see him could you please tell him I'm looking for him?ScenesChandler: You got it!ScenesRoss: Thanks! (walks out of the room and starts hugging the wall) Thank you! (closes the door)ScenesMonica: Other wall, people! Other wall!Scenes(they rush to the wall to Rachel and Joey's, and we move to that room)ScenesRoss: (knocks on door) Rach, you there? (Joey and Rachel both get up from the bed)ScenesJoey: Oh my God, it's Ross. What are we gonna do?ScenesRachel: Oh, ju-ju-just stay calm. Just be calm. For all he knows we're just hanging out together. Right? Just be nonchalant. (Joey like stands at attention with his chest forward and his hands on his sides, looking up at the ceiling with his lips pouted.) That's not nonchalant!ScenesJoey: No idea what it means.ScenesRachel: Oh... okay, just hide!ScenesRoss: (knocks) Rach?ScenesRachel: Coming! Try under the bed, try under the bed!Scenes(When Rachel starts to look under the bed if Joey would fit under there, Chandler opens the door inbetween the rooms, grabs Joey by his shirt and drags him to his room, and closes the door again)ScenesRachel: There's no room under the bed. (looks around because she can't find Joey anymore)ScenesRoss: Is everything okay?ScenesRachel: Yeah... (still looking to see where Joey went, and opens the door)ScenesRoss: Hey.ScenesRachel: Hi...ScenesRoss: You know where Joey is?ScenesRachel: ...I really don't... (looks around again)ScenesRoss: Can I talk to you for a minute?ScenesRachel: Yeah, sure... (looks outside into the corridor if Joey is there)Scenes(Monica and Chandler's room. Phoebe, Monica and Chandler have their ears pressed against the wall, and Joey looks at them)ScenesJoey: I don't believe this... Have you guys been...ScenesPhoebe: Shhh... This is the listening side of the wall.Scenes(Now Joey also wants to listen, and wants to press his ears against the door, which has a big mirror on it, he hesitates seeing himself in the mirror, but still puts his ear against it. We move again to Rachel's room.)ScenesRoss: And then she told me that she and Joey had broken up, and that part of the reason was that she had feelings for me.ScenesRachel: (clearly not listening and still trying to find out where Joey went) Uh-huh... right... yeah...ScenesRoss: And you know I wanted to ask Charlie out since the day I met her.ScenesRachel: (still searching) Oh, I know... I know it's been really hard for you.ScenesRoss: Anyway, one thing lead to another, and... oh... before you know it, we were kissing. I mean, how angry do you think Joey is gonna be?ScenesRachel: (now looking up at the ceiling) That is hard to say, Ross. That is hard to say.ScenesRoss: You know, I gotta go find him. He's gotta be here someplace.ScenesRachel: You would think!Scenes(Ross leaves the room)ScenesRachel: Joey!ScenesJoey: Is he gone?ScenesRachel: (still can't find him) How are you doing this?Scenes(Joey now enters the room through the door, Monica, Chandler and Phoebe are following him.)ScenesJoey: Pssst...ScenesRachel: How... wha... Hey! What are you... What is this? Have you guys been listening this entire time?ScenesMonica, Chandler and Phoebe: YE-AH!ScenesPhoebe: Now, what is this?ScenesRachel: Ah, what is this? Well, lets see, we kissed for ten minutes and now we're talking to our friends about it, so I guess this is sixth grade!ScenesPhoebe: Oh no... Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross?ScenesJoey: Well, he's with Charlie now.ScenesMonica: Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?ScenesJoey: (long pause and he twitches a bit) You're a pain in my ass, Geller!ScenesRachel: All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...ScenesChandler: Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?ScenesRachel: Sure...ScenesChandler: Enunciate!ScenesRachel: Get out!Scenes(They leave and Rachel locks the door.)ScenesRachel: Are they right?ScenesJoey: Probably, yeah... I mean, maybe we should... hold off until we talk to Ross.ScenesRachel: Yeah... Yeah, we can wait, we don't have to do anything tonight.ScenesJoey: Yeah, I think that'd be best... So, so I'm gonna... I'm gonna take off...ScenesRachel: (Joey walks to the door) Although...ScenesJoey: (turns around very fast) I like although!ScenesRachel: I mean, you know... Ross and I haven't dated in like... six years...ScenesJoey: Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...ScenesRachel: Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.ScenesJoey: Absolutely! He's not thinking about you.ScenesRachel: No...ScenesJoey: I'm thinking about you...ScenesRachel: Yeah...ScenesJoey: Let's forget about Ross...ScenesRachel: Forgotten.Scenes(They want to kiss, but just before their lips touch, Rachel pulls back quickly, gasping)ScenesJoey: What's wrong?ScenesRachel: Nothing...ScenesJoey's voice, but she sees Ross: Seriously... What is it?ScenesRachel: Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here, come here...Scenes(again, just before their lips touch, she pulls back, gasping)ScenesJoey's voice/Ross: What's wrong?ScenesRachel: Sorry, I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out of my head...ScenesJoey: Well, maybe I can help. (he grabs her head passionately, closes his eyes and kisses... Ross in Rachel's dress! He realises it too late, and when he does, pushes Ross's/Rachel's head away)ScenesRachel/Ross: Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do that again... (and she/he moves in for another kiss. Joey, pushes her head away again...)ScenesJoey: Yeah... we really need to talk to Ross...ScenesBoth: YeahScenesCOMMERCIAL BREAK"

Only one of us has to stay with Emma. Ok, and as the person who realized that, I get to go!ScenesMonica: No! no! Let's figure out a fair way to decide who's staying.ScenesJoey: Oh! I got it!

I want the dolphin!ScenesChandler: Thats a bear.ScenesPhoebe: I'm too excited!ScenesMonica: Phoebe, you get the bear, uhm, Joey, you get the robot, and Chandler and I get the dog.

GO!!!Scenes(Monica, Phoebe and Joey release their wind-up toys.)ScenesPhoebe: Go! Go!ScenesJoey: Come on robot!Scenes(Phoebe's bear takes the lead, followed by Joey's robot, and far behind is Chandler and Monica's dog, which walks a few paces, stops and starts barking, sits, walks again, and so on... )ScenesMonica: (to the dog) What are you barking at?Scenes(While Phoebe's bear is still in the lead, it is now closely followed by Joey's robot. Chandler and Monica's dog however, sits down, barking... and does a backflip.)ScenesMonica: Wha... How the hell is that gonna help?ScenesChandler: I bought you. How did I forget that that's all you do?Scenes(Meanwhile the race has been won by Phoebe's bear, followed by Joey's robot)ScenesJoey: Way to go robot!ScenesPhoebe: Good job Alan!ScenesJoey: Hey, good race you guys.ScenesPhoebe: Yeah, see you later!Scenes(Joey and Phoebe leave for the door)ScenesMonica: No! No, no... wait! We didn't lose. (turns to Chandler) The rules clearly stated that the last one to cross the finish line was the loser. Well, our dog never crossed the finish line, so technically...ScenesChandler: They left.Scenes(Monica turns to see the closed door.)Scenes[ Scene: The freeway. Rachel is driving Monica's Porsche, while using her mobile phone. Ross is sitting next to her.]ScenesRachel: (into the phone) No, there isn't time to go to the bakery. We're just gonna come home... Everybody left? Alright, well just tell Emma we're gonna be there as soon as we can. (emotionally) Bye...Scenes(She hangs up, closes her phone, turns around and puts it in her bag which is in the back of the car. While doing this and not looking at the road, she turns the steering wheel by accident, which makes the car swerve.)ScenesRoss: RACHEL!ScenesRachel: OOH! God! Sorry!ScenesRoss: (sarcastically) I can't believe they gave you a ticket. You're such a good driver.Scenes(Ross fastens his seat belt.)ScenesRachel: Emma's awake.ScenesRoss: Yeah?ScenesRachel: I can't believe this. This is her first birthday. She's awake. We're not even there. Everybody left. We still have this stupid obscene cake.ScenesRoss: Hey, maybe I can fix that, you know. Try to turn it into something else. (he opens the box)ScenesRachel: Oh, why do you even bother? I already ruined her first birthday... And do you know how important these early experiences are Ross? Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.ScenesRoss: Rach, she's not going to remember this.ScenesRachel: (shakes her head) I guess... Oh, I just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know? Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake singing \"Happy Birthday\". Then we would all go into... HEY GET OUT OF THE ROAD YOU STUPID STUDENT DRIVER!!! (honks furiously, and Ross looks at her in disbelief and Rachel looks at him.) They have to learn!ScenesRoss: (looks back at the cake) Hey!ScenesRachel: What?ScenesRoss: It's not bad.ScenesRachel: (she looks at the cake) Oh my God! Look what... you made it into a bunny. How did you do that?ScenesRoss: Well, I just made these two things uhm... cheeks. And then I split this to make ears.ScenesRachel: Well, I'm very impressed.ScenesRoss: Some can sing, some can dance. I apparently can turn phallic cakes into woodland creatures.Scenes[ Scene: Rachel and Joey's apartment. Chandler, Monica and Emma are sitting on the floor, and Emma's stuffed animals are lined up in front of them.]ScenesMonica: Now another way to organise your stuffed animals, is by size.ScenesChandler: I'm sorry, is this a game for Emma or for Monica?ScenesMonica: Game?ScenesChandler: Emma, you even know it's your birthday today? You're one! One-year-old, that's little.Scenes(With his index finger he shows her how old she is. Emma also points her finger and babbles...)ScenesChandler: Ooh! That's my girl!ScenesMonica: That's how old you are.ScenesChandler: Did I teach her that? Did I just... impart wisdom?ScenesMonica: (embraces Emma tightly) Ooh, I want one...ScenesChandler: Me too...Scenes(There's a couple of seconds of silence. Then Chandler looks around...)ScenesChandler: There's no-one around. Why don't we just take this one?ScenesMonica: ...and head to Canada!ScenesChandler: I was kidding.ScenesMonica: I wasn't. Let's get going!Scenes(Phoebe enters the apartment again.)ScenesPhoebe: Hey, are Ross and Rachel back?ScenesChandler: No, not yet.ScenesPhoebe: Oh good, I didn't miss the party.ScenesMonica: What about your massage client?ScenesPhoebe: I just felt so bad, missing this. So I just slipped him a little something, you know. As long as I'm back in five or six hours, it will be alright.Scenes(Joey comes running into the apartment, out of breath.)ScenesJoey: Okay, if Ross and Rachel ask, I've been here the whole time. THE WHOLE TIME!Scenes(Ross and Rachel enter.)ScenesJoey: (to Ross and Rachel) I've been here the whole time!ScenesRoss: Joey, we just saw you come in. You ran past us on the stairs.ScenesRachel: I don't care that you left. I'm just glad that you're here. Thanks you guys!ScenesChandler: Hey, guys! Come on! You gotta see what Emma just did.ScenesRachel: What?ScenesChandler: Emma, how old are you? How old are you today? (holds up his index finger again)ScenesEmma: Wo-ish. (and holds up her finger)Scenes(Ross and Rachel gasp)ScenesRachel: Oh! Emma, that's right! You're that many!ScenesRoss: Oh my God! Our daughter's a genius! Rach, this means...ScenesRachel: (angrily) NO, no science camp!ScenesRoss: Damnit! I'll put a candle on the cake.ScenesRachel: Oh!... Oh and Emma, look at your stuffed animals lined up so neatly!ScenesMonica: Thanks!ScenesRoss: Okay, here we go! Emma's first birthday cake... Well hey... well, blow out the candle. Come on Emma.ScenesChandler: Let's do it, come on!Scenes(Rachel wipes away some tears.)ScenesRoss: What's wrong? Are you okay?ScenesRachel: Oh yeah, nothing! These are happy tears! This is just what I wanted.ScenesPhoebe: (pointing at cake) Hey, you made it into a bunny.ScenesJoey: What is wrong with me. It looked more delicious when it was a penis.ScenesENDING CREDITS "

Have you thought about it how complicated this could get? What about Ross?ScenesJoey: Well, he's with Charlie now.ScenesMonica: Yeah, but he wants to talk to you before anything really happens with her. And as his friend, I mean, don't you think he deserves the same from you?ScenesJoey: (long pause and he twitches a bit) You're a pain in my ass, Geller!ScenesRachel: All right, look you guys... Look, we appreciate all the advice, but this is between Joey and me and I think we can handle it...ScenesChandler: Okay, well we'll go back in there, but will you do one thing for us? The people that care about you?ScenesRachel: Sure...ScenesChandler: Enunciate!ScenesRachel: Get out!Scenes(They leave and Rachel locks the door.)ScenesRachel: Are they right?ScenesJoey: Probably, yeah...

Ross and I haven't dated in like... six years...ScenesJoey: Six years? Wow... It's almost as long as highschool...ScenesRachel: Plus, you know, he is with Charlie now.ScenesJoey: Absolutely! He's not thinking about you.ScenesRachel: No...ScenesJoey: I'm thinking about you...ScenesRachel: Yeah...ScenesJoey: Let's forget about Ross...ScenesRachel: Forgotten.Scenes(They want to kiss, but just before their lips touch, Rachel pulls back quickly, gasping)ScenesJoey: What's wrong?ScenesRachel: Nothing...ScenesJoey's voice, but she sees Ross: Seriously... What is it?ScenesRachel: Nothing... It's really... It's nothing... Come here, come here...Scenes(again, just before their lips touch, she pulls back, gasping)ScenesJoey's voice/Ross: What's wrong?ScenesRachel: Sorry, I just uhm... I can't seem to get Ross out of my head...ScenesJoey: Well, maybe I can help. (he grabs her head passionately, closes his eyes and kisses... Ross in Rachel's dress! He realises it too late, and when he does, pushes Ross's/Rachel's head away)ScenesRachel/Ross: Ooh, your lips are so soft... Do that again... (and she/he moves in for another kiss.
