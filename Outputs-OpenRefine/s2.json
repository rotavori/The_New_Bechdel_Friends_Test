Ross was in love with Rachel since, you know, forever, but every time he tried to tell her, something kind of got in the way, like cats, and Italian guys. Finally Chandler was like \"forget about her\" but when Ross was in China on his dig, Chandler let it slip that Ross was in love with Rachel. She was like, \"Oh my god.\" So she went to the airport to meet him when he came back, but what she didn't know was, that Ross was getting off the plane with another woman. Uh-Oh! So, that's pretty much everything you need to know. But, enough about us. So, how've you been?ScenesOpening CreditsScenes[Scene, The Airport, continued from last season, Rachel is waiting for Ross to come of the plane, when she sees he's coming off with another woman.]ScenesRachel: Oh my god.

Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.ScenesPHOEBE: Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.ScenesROSS: It's the only possibility, Phoebe.ScenesPHOEBE: Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?ScenesROSS: There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.ScenesPHOEBE: I can't believe you caved.ScenesROSS: What?ScenesPHOEBE: You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys?

And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. \"Run away from Crazy Snake Man,\" they'll shout!ScenesMONICA: You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.ScenesCHANDLER: Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.ScenesRACHEL: Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.ScenesMONICA: You are not a freak. You're a guy.ScenesRACHEL: She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.ScenesMONICA: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is.

Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.ScenesMONICA: Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person.

That's gotta suck, huh?Scenes(at Monica and Rachel's)ScenesCHANDLER: Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?ScenesMONICA: I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.ScenesPHOEBE: Oh, it's like a skit.ScenesMONICA: Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.ScenesROSS: Whoo!ScenesPHOEBE: Cool.ScenesMONICA: Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.ScenesROSS: But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?ScenesCHANDLER: By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.ScenesROSS: Come on.ScenesCHANDLER: Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!ScenesMONICA: It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.ScenesPHOEBE: So...Thank you.ScenesROSS: Could you be less enthused?ScenesJOEY: Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--ScenesMONICA: Like?ScenesJOEY: Charity.ScenesMONICA: Charity?ScenesROSS: We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.ScenesRACHEL: Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.ScenesPHOEBE: Actually, it makes us feel that big.ScenesROSS: I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.ScenesCHANDLER: If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.ScenesJOEY: Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.ScenesRACHEL: Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.ScenesPHOEBE: I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.ScenesRACHEL: Me neither.ScenesJOEY: Me too.ScenesMONICA: Guys, we bought the tickets.ScenesPHOEBE: Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.ScenesCHANDLER: Why did you look at me when you said that?ScenesMONICA: Well, I guess now we can't go.ScenesRACHEL: What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?ScenesMONICA: You know what? You're right.ScenesPHOEBE: Fine.ScenesROSS: Fine.ScenesJOEY: Fine.ScenesCHANDLER: Fine.ScenesRACHEL: Fine.ScenesMONICA: All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.ScenesROSS: Chandler!ScenesCHANDLER: Yeah?ScenesROSS: Geez! Are you ready?ScenesCHANDLER: Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.ScenesROSS: Whoa! You had sex today?ScenesCHANDLER: Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.ScenesROSS: Wow.ScenesCHANDLER: Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.Scenes(phone rings)ScenesROSS: Still doing the screening thing?ScenesCHANDLER: I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.ScenesMACHINE: Here comes the beep, you know what to do.ScenesJADE: Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.ScenesCHANDLER: Bob here.ScenesJADE: Oh, hi.ScenesCHANDLER: So, uh, you met someone, huh?ScenesJADE: Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago.ScenesCHANDLER: So, uh, how was he?ScenesJADE: Eh.ScenesCHANDLER: Eh?ScenesJADE: Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.ScenesCHANDLER: Well, that makes me feel so good.ScenesJADE: It was just so awkward and bumpy.ScenesROSS: (silently mouthing) Bumpy?ScenesCHANDLER: Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.ScenesJADE: Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?Scenes(at the concert)ScenesMONICA: You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.ScenesROSS: Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.ScenesCHANDLER: So, let's go.ScenesROSS: Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.ScenesCHANDLER: Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.ScenesMONICA: You know, the guys are probably having a great time.Scenes(at Monica and Rachel's)ScenesJOEY: Come on you guys, one more time.ScenesPHOEBE: Ok. One.ScenesJOEY: Nooo.ScenesMONICA: That was amazing!ScenesROSS: Excellent, that was excellent.ScenesCHANDLER: I can't believe the guys missed this.ScenesROSS: What guys? Oh, yeah.ScenesSTEVE: Excuse me, you're Monica Geller aren't you?ScenesMONICA: Do I know you?ScenesSTEVE: You used to be my babysitter.ScenesMONICA: Oh my god, little Stevie Fisher? How've you been?ScenesSTEVE: Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.ScenesMONICA: You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.ScenesSTEVE: Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.ScenesMONICA: Uh, wait, backstage?ScenesSTEVE: Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.ScenesROSS: Ross.ScenesCHANDLER: Chandler.ScenesSTEVE: How are you? Look, you guys wanna meet the group? Come on. So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?Scenes(at Central Perk)ScenesROSS: Hey, you guys.ScenesRACHEL: Happy birthday.ScenesROSS: Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?ScenesRACHEL: Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?ScenesMONICA: Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?ScenesRACHEL: Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?ScenesMONICA: Uh, good.ScenesROSS: Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.ScenesCHANDLER: Yeah, we really missed you guys.ScenesJOEY: Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.ScenesPHOEBE: We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?ScenesMONICA: No, I just, I fell down.ScenesRACHEL: On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?ScenesMONICA: You know, a party, or--ScenesRACHEL: What party?ScenesROSS: It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.ScenesJOEY: You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?ScenesCHANDLER: Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.ScenesRACHEL: Who gave you that hickey?ScenesMONICA: That would be the work of a Blowfish.ScenesRACHEL: Oh!ScenesPHOEBE: Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, \"hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck\".ScenesROSS: Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.ScenesRACHEL: What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?Scenes(Monica's pager goes off)ScenesMONICA: It's work.ScenesCHANDLER: I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.ScenesJOEY: And we don't work hard?ScenesMONICA: (on phone) Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.ScenesCHANDLER: I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.ScenesJOEY: And you feel like we hold you back.ScenesCHANDLER: Yes.ScenesRACHEL: Oh!ScenesCHANDLER: No.ScenesMONICA: Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.ScenesPHOEBE: Oh.Scenes(Everyone goes over to comfort Monica)ScenesWAITRESS: Here's your check. That'll be $4.12.ScenesJOEY: Let me get that. (to Chandler) You got five bucks?ScenesMACHINE: Here comes the beep, you know what to do.ScenesJADE: Hi, it's me. Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here.

Um, so does your guitar have a strap?ScenesSTEPHANIE: No.ScenesPHOEBE: Oh. Mine does. (singing) Stephanie knows all the chords. (makes a face)ScenesCHANDLER: (on pay phone) Come on, pick up, pick up! Hello? Transit Authority? Yes, hello. I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Yes I do realize that would be a very stupid charact er.ScenesJOEY: Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller. Oh, and there was a baby in it. He wants to talk to you again.ScenesRACHEL: Ok, everybody, let's give a uh nice warm Central Perk welcome to--ScenesPHOEBE: (singing angrily) Terry's a jerk, and he won't let me work, and I hate Central Perk!ScenesRACHEL: Uh, to Stephanie Schiffer.ScenesSTEPHANIE: Thank you.

Remember, he had that cute little mole by his mouth.ScenesCHANDLER: Yeah?ScenesJOEY: Yeah.ScenesCHANDLER: Hey, Ben, remember us? Ok, the mole came off.ScenesJOEY: Ahh!ScenesCHANDLER: What're we gonna do? What're we gonna do?ScenesJOEY: Uh, uh, we'll flip for it. Ducks or clowns.ScenesCHANDLER: Oh, we're gonna flip for the baby?ScenesJOEY: You got a better idea? ScenesCHANDLER: All right, call it in the air.ScenesJOEY: Heads.ScenesCHANDLER: Heads it is.ScenesJOEY: Yes! Whew!ScenesCHANDLER: We have to assign heads to something.ScenesJOEY: Right.

But not really, 'cause I put in the first two, just to, you know, get the ball rolling, and to make myself feel better.ScenesRACHEL: Do you?ScenesPHOEBE: No. This whole like playing-for-money thing is so not good for me. You know, I don't know, when I sang \"Su-Su-Suicide\", I got a dollar seventy-five. But then, \"Smelly Cat\", I got 25 cents and a condom.

You know, I mean, if all you've ever actually had are healthy pets, then, whoosh!ScenesPHOEBE: It's not even that. I used to do my songs because it made me happy, but now it's like, it's just all about the money.ScenesRACHEL: Well, people missed you in there. And in fact, there was actually a request for \"Smelly Cat\".ScenesPHOEBE: Really? From who?ScenesRACHEL: Well, from me. And I know it's not your big money song, but it's my favorite.ScenesKID: Hi.

What do you think this is, a freckle?ScenesROSS: Oh.ScenesMONICA: Wait, what about the time I hit you in the face with the Silvian's pumpkin?ScenesROSS: Oh, man. Oh, remember when I stuck that broom in your bike spokes, and you flipped over and hit your head on the curb? ScenesMONICA: No. But I remember people telling me about it.ScenesROSS: I hope Ben has a little sister.ScenesMONICA: Yeah. I hope she can kick his ass.ScenesROSS: I'm gonna get a new band-aid.

It's about us.ScenesROSS: Oh, you and me?ScenesCAROL: Uh, no, Susan and me.ScenesSUSAN: The other us.ScenesROSS: Ok.ScenesCAROL: We're uh, we're getting married.ScenesROSS: As in, \"I now pronounce you wife and wife\" married?ScenesCAROL: Anyway, we'd like you to come, but we totally understand if you don't want to.ScenesROSS: Why wouldn't I want to come? I had fun at the first wedding.ScenesCAROL: Look I just thought that...ScenesROSS: No no no, I mean, hey, why shouldn't I be happy for you? What would it say about me if I couldn't revel in your joy? I'm revelling baby, believe me!ScenesSUSAN: Is your finger caught in that chair?ScenesROSS: Mmm hmmm.ScenesCAROL: Want us to go?ScenesROSS: Uh-huh.Scenes[at Rachel and Monica's]ScenesROSS: This is so cool. You're actually gonna be on television.ScenesJOEY: It really hit me last night. I'm gonna be on Days of our Lives. And then I started thinkin' about all of u, and how these are the days of our lives..ScenesMONICA: Yes! Carol and Susan's caterer had a mountain bike accident this weekend, and she's in a full body cast.ScenesROSS, CHANDLER & JOEY: Yes!ScenesMONICA: They want me to do it, which is really cool, seeing as I've never catered before, and I really need the money, and this isn't a problem for you, is it?ScenesROSS: Would it matter?ScenesMONICA: Oh, you are so great! [kisses him] Thank you!ScenesJOEY: Are you really not going?ScenesROSS: I am really not going. I don't get it. They already live together, why do they need to get married?ScenesMONICA: They love each other, and they wanna celebrate that love with the people that are close with them.ScenesROSS: If you wanna call that a reason.ScenesCHANDLER: [singing to the tune of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood] Who's the bitterest man in the living room, the bitterest man in the living room? Hi, neighbor.ScenesMONICA: Ross, I thought you were over this.ScenesROSS: Look, that has nothing to do with this, ok? She's my ex-wife. If she were marrying a guy, none of you'd expect me to be there.ScenesJOEY: Hey, if she were marrying a guy, she'd be like the worst lesbian ever.ScenesRACHEL: [entering hurriedly] Did I miss it? Did I miss it?ScenesJOEY: No, I'm on right after this guy shoots himself.ScenesCHANDLER: Whoa, she's pretty.ScenesJOEY: Yeah, and she's really nice too. She taught me all about how to work the cameras, and smell-the-fart acting.ScenesRACHEL: I'm sorry, what?ScenesMONICA: What?ScenesJOEY: It's like, you got so many lines to learn so fast, that sometimes you need a minute to remember your next one. So while you're thinkin' of it, you take this big pause where you look all intense, you know, like this.ScenesCHANDLER: Oh, ok.ScenesJOEY: There's my scene, there's my scene. [Joey on tv] \"Mrs. Wallace, I'm Dr. Drake Ramoray, your sister's neurosurgeon.ScenesMRS. WALLACE: Is she gonna be all right?ScenesJOEY: I'm afraid the situation is much worse than we expected. Your sister is suffering from a..subcranial hematoma. Perhaps we can discuss this over coffee.ScenesCHANDLER: Nice!ScenesRACHEL: That's great!ScenesROSS: Excellent!ScenesCHANDLER: For a minute there I thought you were actually tryin' to smell something.Scenes[Monica and Rachel's]ScenesROSS: That is so good! Do it again!ScenesJOEY: All right, all right. \"Damnit Braverman, it's right there on the chart!ScenesCHANDLER: That's great. All right, I gotta get to work, I got a big dinosaur bone to inspect.ScenesROSS: No no, that's me.ScenesCHANDLER: Oh, yeah.ScenesROSS: Oh, hello.ScenesPHOEBE: Oh, thanks. I couldn't uh...ScenesROSS: Is everything ok?ScenesPHOEBE: Um, no, huh-uh. One of my clients died on the massage table today.ScenesROSS: Oh my god.ScenesCHANDLER: That's a little more relaxed than you want them to get.ScenesPHOEBE: Yeah, um, she was 82 years old. Her name was um, Mrs. Adelman.ScenesMONICA: Oh, honey.ScenesPHOEBE: Yeah, it's just so strange. I mean, she probably woke up today and thought, \"ok, I'll have some breakfast, and then I'll take a little walk, and then I'll have my massage.\" Little did she know God was thinking, \"Ok, but that's it.\" Oh, but the weirdest thing was, ok, I was cleansing her aura when she died, and when the spirit left her body, I don't think it went very far.ScenesRACHEL: What do you mean?ScenesPHOEBE: I think it went into me.Scenes[Everyone takes a step back from Phoebe]Scenes[Central Perk]ScenesMONICA: God, this is so hard. I can't decide between lamb or duck.ScenesCHANDLER: Well, of course, lambs are scarier. Otherwise the movie would've been called Silence of the Ducks.ScenesRACHEL: Ok, who ordered what?ScenesROSS: Oh, I believe I had the half-drunk cappuccino with the lipstick on the rim.ScenesCHANDLER: Yes, and this with the cigarette butt in it, is that decaf?ScenesRACHEL: Oh god.ScenesJOEY: I can't believe you're so uptight about your mom comin'.ScenesRACHEL: I know, but it's just it's the first time, and I just don't want her to think that because I didn't marry Barry, that my life is total crap, you know?ScenesPHOEBE: [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Talk about crap. Try listening to Stella Niedman tell the story of her and Rod Steiger for the hundredth time.ScenesJOEY: Uh, Pheebs, how long do you think this lady'll be with us?ScenesPHOEBE: I don't know. I mean, she obviously has some kind of unfinished business. [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Sit up!ScenesMRS. GREEN: [entering] There she is.ScenesRACHEL: Mom!ScenesMRS GREEN: Sweetie! So this is where you work? Oh, it's wonderful! Is it a living room? Is it a restaurant? Who can tell? But I guess that's the fun.ScenesRACHEL: Pretty much.ScenesMRS GREEN: Monica! You look gorgeous! Last time I saw you, it was eat or be eaten.ScenesRACHEL: This is Joey, and Phoebe, and this is Chandler, and you remember Ross.ScenesMRS GREEN: Oh hello, Ross.ScenesROSS: Hi, Mrs. Green. [He gets up to shake her hand, but she ignores him.]ScenesMRS GREEN: So, what do you think of my daughter in the apron with the big job?ScenesRACHEL: Oh Mom!ScenesMRS GREEN: If you didn't pour the coffee, no one would have anything to drink.ScenesCHANDLER: Believe me, sometimes that happens.ScenesMRS GREEN: This is just so exciting. You know, I never worked. I went straight from my father's house to the sorority house to my husband's house. I am just so proud of you.ScenesRACHEL: Really?ScenesMRS GREEN: Yes.ScenesPHOEBE: I know who it is you remind me of. Evelyn Dermer. 'Course, that's before she got the lousy face lift. Now she looks like Soupy Sales.ScenesJOEY: Pheebs, who's Evelyn Dermer?ScenesPHOEBE: I don't know. Who's Soupy Sales?Scenes[at Rachel and Monica'sScenesMRS GREEN: Oh my god, there's an unattractive nude man playing the cello.ScenesRACHEL: Yeah, well just be glad he's not playing a smaller instrument.ScenesMRS GREEN: [laughing] You have some life here, sweetie.ScenesRACHEL: I know. And Mom, I realize you and Daddy were upset when I didn't marry Barry and get the big house in the suburbs with all the security and everything, but this is just so much better for me, you know?ScenesMRS GREEN: I do. You didn't love Barry. And I've never seen you this happy. I look at you and I think, oh, this is what I want.ScenesRACHEL: For...me.ScenesMRS GREEN: Well, not just for you.ScenesRACHEL: Well, what do you mean?ScenesMRS GREEN: I'm uh, considering leaving your father.ScenesMONICA: [entering] All right. Tell me if this is too cute. Lesbian wedding, chicken breasts.ScenesRACHEL: Oh god. I think I'm gonna be sick.ScenesMONICA: Why? It's not like I'm putting little nipples on them.ScenesROSS: And you had no idea they weren't getting along?ScenesRACHEL: None.ScenesJOEY: They didn't fight a lot?ScenesRACHEL: No! They didn't even talk to each other. God, how was I supposed to know they were having problems?ScenesPHOEBE: [Mrs. Adelman's voice] In my day, divorce was not an option.ScenesJOEY: Hey, look who's up.ScenesRACHEL: I just can't believe this is happening. I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced. I just figured as a grownup I wouldn't have to worry about this.ScenesMONICA: Is there any chance that you can look at this as flattering? I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.ScenesRACHEL: Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?ScenesCHANDLER: You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.ScenesPHOEBE: That's him.ScenesCHANDLER: Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.ScenesMR A: Phoebe?ScenesPHOEBE: Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.ScenesMR A: Oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.ScenesPHOEBE: Um, do you wanna sit?ScenesMR A: Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear?ScenesPHOEBE: I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.ScenesMR A: You're saying, my wife is in you?ScenesPHOEBE: Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?ScenesMR A: Well, I don't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.ScenesPHOEBE: Everything?ScenesMR A: Everything.ScenesPHOEBE: Whoa, that's a lot of stuff.ScenesMR A: Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.ScenesPHOEBE: I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.ScenesMR A: [to Joey] Worth a shot, huh?Scenes[Joey nods and shrugs.]ScenesMRS GREEN: Look at this.ScenesRACHEL: These are from Halloween three years ago.ScenesMRS GREEN: Oh, look, here's Barry. Did he have to come straight from the office?ScenesRACHEL: No, that was his costume. See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.ScenesMONICA: Um, you guys, you know when I said before, \"thank you, but I don't really need your help\"?ScenesRACHEL: Actually, what I think you said was, \"don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen.ScenesMONICA: Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.ScenesRACHEL: Hey, Mon, you want some help?ScenesMONICA: If you want.ScenesPHOEBE: [enters] Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.ScenesRACHEL: She's still with you?ScenesPHOEBE: Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet. I'll be right back, she has to go to the bathroom again. [Takes Mrs. Green's chin in her hand and says, in Mrs. Adelman's voice] Oh, such a pretty face.ScenesMRS GREEN: This is so much fun, just the girls. You know what we should do? Does anybody have any marijuana?ScenesRACHEL: God!ScenesMONICA: All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.ScenesMRS GREEN: That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex?ScenesRACHEL: Oh! What's new in sex?ScenesMRS GREEN: The only man I've ever been with is your father.ScenesMONICA: I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.ScenesMRS GREEN: I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more.ScenesRACHEL: Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?ScenesMRS GREEN: No.ScenesRACHEL: You want me to talk you out of it?ScenesMRS GREEN: No.ScenesRACHEL: Then what? What do you want?ScenesMRS GREEN: I guess I just figured of all people you would understand this.ScenesRACHEL: Why on earth would I understand this?ScenesMRS GREEN: You didn't marry your Barry. I did.ScenesRACHEL: Oh.ScenesMONICA: All right people, we're in trouble here. We've only got 12 hours and 36 minutes left. Move, move, move!ScenesCHANDLER: Monica, I feel like you should have German subtitles.ScenesMONICA: Joey, speed it up!ScenesJOEY: I'm sorry, it's the pigs. they're reluctant to get in the blankets!ScenesPHOEBE: Monica, how did this happen? I thought you had this all planned out.ScenesMONICA: Do you want me to cry? Is that what you want? Do you wanna see me cry?ScenesPHOEBE: Sir! No sir!ScenesMONICA: [to Ross] All right, you!ScenesROSS: No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.ScenesMONICA: All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called \"pigs in Ross\". All right, ball the melon.ScenesCHANDLER: Hey! How come I'm stuck dicing, when he gets to ball the melon.Scenes[knock at the door]ScenesMONICA: Hi.ScenesCAROL: How's it going?ScenesMONICA: It's goin' great. Right on schedule. Got my little happy helpers.[everyone groans]ScenesCAROL: Fine, whatever.ScenesROSS: What's the matter?ScenesCAROL: Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.ScenesROSS: What?ScenesMONICA: You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.ScenesROSS: Carol, what's the matter? What happened?ScenesCAROL: My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.ScenesROSS: Oh my god.ScenesCAROL: I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything.ScenesROSS: It's ok. I'm sorry.ScenesCAROL: And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.ScenesROSS: I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.ScenesCAROL: You do?ScenesROSS: Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.ScenesCAROL: Of course I do.ScenesROSS: Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.ScenesCAROL: You're right. Of course you're right.ScenesMONICA: So we're back on?ScenesCAROL: We're back on.ScenesMONICA: You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil! I can't believe I lost 2 minutes.Scenes[at the wedding]ScenesJOEY: It just seems so futile, you know ? All these women, and nothing. I feel like Superman without my powers, you know? I have the cape, and yet I cannot fly.ScenesCHANDLER: Well now you understand how I feel every single day, ok? The world is my lesbian wedding.Scenes[Wedding music starts, Phoebe noisily unwraps a piece of candy.]ScenesPHOEBE: [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Butterscotch? No one? All right, you'll be sorry later.Scenes[Monica pushes Ben down the aisle in a stroller. Susan is escorted by both her parents. Carol is escorted by Ross.]ScenesCAROL: Thank you.ScenesROSS: Any time. [He doesn't want to let her go]ScenesCAROL: Ross. [He lets her go]ScenesMINISTER: You know, nothing makes God happier than when two people, any two people, come together in love. Friends, family, we're gathered here today to join Carol and Susan in holy matrimony.ScenesPHOEBE: [Mrs. Adelman's voice] Oh my god. Now I've seen everything! [Phoebe's voice] Whoa, she's gone. She's gone. She's gone! Go ahead, get married. Go, go.Scenes[At the reception, Monica and Ross watch Carol and Susan getting their picture taken.]ScenesMONICA: Would you look at them?ScenesROSS: Yeah, can't help but.ScenesJOEY: [to a wedding guest] How's that pig-in-the-blanket workin' out for you? [the guy nods] I wrapped those bad boys.ScenesPHOEBE: I miss Rose.ScenesCHANDLER: Oh, yeah?ScenesPHOEBE: I know it's kind of weird, but I mean, she was a big part of my life there, you know, and now I just feel kind of alone.ScenesWOMAN: You know, I uh, I couldn't help but overhear what you just said, and I think it's time for you to forget about Rose, move on with your life...how 'bout we go get you a drink?ScenesPHOEBE: Ok, that's so nice.Scenes[Chandler tries to warn Phoebe that the woman is coming on to her, but Phoebe doesn't see him.]ScenesCHANDLER: [to an attractive woman] I shouldn't even bother coming up with a line, right? [The woman walks away]ScenesRACHEL: Hey, Mom? Having fun?ScenesMRS GREEN: Oh, am I! I just danced with a wonderfully large woman. And three other girls made eyes at me over the buffet. Oh, I'm not saying it's something I wanna pursue, but it's nice to know I have options.ScenesRACHEL: There's more alcohol, right?Scenes[Susan approaches Ross, who's looking lonely]ScenesSUSAN: How you doin'?ScenesROSS: Ok.ScenesSUSAN: You did a good thing today.ScenesROSS: Yeah.ScenesSUSAN: You wanna dance?ScenesROSS: No, that's fine.ScenesSUSAN: Come on. I'll let you lead.ScenesROSS: Ok.Scenes[They dance; Carol looks on lovingly.]ScenesCHANDLER: [to the woman who just rejected him] All right look. Penis schmenis. We're all people. [She walks away again.]Scenes[at Monica and Rachel's]ScenesMONICA: Ok, which one of us do you think is gonna be the first one to get married?ScenesROSS: Well, Mon, I was married.ScenesPHOEBE: Yeah, me, too, technically.ScenesRACHEL: I had a wedding.ScenesMONICA: All right, just trying to start an interesting discussion.ScenesJOEY: I got one. Which one of us do you think will be the last to get married? [They all look at Chandler]ScenesCHANDLER: Isn't Ben in this?ScenesALL: Oh, yeah!ScenesENDScenescontrl08.gif (14783 bytes)ScenesThe One After the SuperbowlScenesOriginally written by Michael Borkow, Mike Sikowitz & Jeffrey Astrof ScenesTranscribed by Joshua Hodge.ScenesMinor additions and adjustments by Dan Silverstein."

Yeah, sure, I'm coming up 30 years behind him, but the stops are all the same. Bitter Town. Aloneville. Hermit Junction.ScenesJOEY: All right, you know what we gotta do? We gotta get you outta here. Come on, I'll buy you breakfast, let's go.ScenesCHANDLER: What if I never find someone? Or worse, what if I've found her, but I dumped her because she pronounced it \"supposably\"?ScenesJOEY: Chandler, come on, you're gonna find somebody.ScenesCHANDLER: How do you know that? How?ScenesJOEY: I don't know, I'm just tryin' to help you out.ScenesCHANDLER: You'll see, you guys are all gonna go off and get married, and I'm gonna end up alone. Will you promise me something? When you're married, will you invite me over for holidays?ScenesJOEY: Well, I don't know. I don't know what we're gonna be doin'. I mean, what if we're at her folks' place?ScenesCHANDLER: Yeah, I understand.ScenesJOEY: You can come over and watch the Super Bowl. Every year, all right?ScenesCHANDLER: You know what? I'm not gonna end up like this. I'll see you man.ScenesJOEY: Supposably. Supposably. Did they go to the zoo? Supposably.ScenesCHANDLER: (on phone) Hi, it's me.ScenesJANICE: Oh, my, god.ScenesPHOEBE: Janice? You called Janice?ScenesCHANDLER: Yes, Janice. Why is that so difficult for you to comprehend?ScenesROSS: You remember Janice, right?ScenesCHANDLER: Yes. She was smart, she was pretty, and she honestly cared about me. Janice is my last chance to have somebody.ScenesJANICE: Helloo!!ScenesCHANDLER: Oh, my, god!ScenesJOEY: Geez, look how fat she got.ScenesJANICE: Hey, it's everybody.ScenesCHANDLER: Janice, you're--ScenesJANICE: Yes, I am.ScenesCHANDLER: Is it--?ScenesJANICE: Is it yours?

It's Scary Scientist Man.ScenesROSS: Ok, Phoebe, this is it. In this briefcase I carry actual scientific facts. A briefcase of facts, if you will. Some of these fossils are over 200 million years old.ScenesPHOEBE: Ok, look, before you even start, I'm not denying evolution, ok, I'm just saying that it's one of the possibilities.ScenesROSS: It's the only possibility, Phoebe.ScenesPHOEBE: Ok, Ross, could you just open your mind like this much, ok? Wasn't there a time when the brightest minds in the world believed that the world was flat? And, up until like what, 50 years ago, you all thought the atom was the smallest thing, until you split it open, and this like, whole mess of crap came out. Now, are you telling me that you are so unbelievably arrogant that you can't admit that there's a teeny tiny possibility that you could be wrong about this?ScenesROSS: There might be, a teeny, tiny, possibility.ScenesPHOEBE: I can't believe you caved.ScenesROSS: What?ScenesPHOEBE: You just abandoned your whole belief system. I mean, before, I didn't agree with you, but at least I respected you. How, how, how are you going to go into work tomorrow? How, how are you going to face the other science guys? How, how are you going to face yourself? Oh! That was fun. So who's hungry?ScenesRACHEL: I am. Let me just get my coat.ScenesMONICA: Ok, all right. It was an accident, I swear, all right. I was putting on my jacket, and the thing, and the lamp, and it broke.ScenesRACHEL: Oh, please, Monica. You've always hated my lamp, and then, all of a sudden, it's just magically broken?ScenesMONICA: Phoebe, tell her!ScenesPHOEBE: Ok, I didn't see it, because I was putting on my jacket, but I uh want to believe you.ScenesRACHEL: Hey Chandler. Monica just broke my seashell lamp.ScenesCHANDLER: Neat. I'm gonna die alone.ScenesRACHEL: Ok, you win.ScenesMONICA: Chandler, you're not gonna die alone.ScenesCHANDLER: Janice was my safety net, ok? And now I have to get a snake.ScenesPHOEBE: Uh huh. Why is that?ScenesCHANDLER: If I'm gonna be an old, lonely man, I'm gonna need a thing, you know, a hook, like that guy on the subway who eats his own face. So I figure I'll be Crazy Man with a Snake, y=know. Crazy Snake Man. And I'll get more snakes, call them my babies, kids will walk past my place, they will run. \"Run away from Crazy Snake Man,\" they'll shout!ScenesMONICA: You have got to get over this. You're not gonna end up alone.ScenesCHANDLER: Of course I am. I reject anyone who's crazy enough to actually go out with me, and then I bitch about the fact that there aren't any great women out there.ScenesRACHEL: Chandler, you have just described virtually every man that we have ever gone out with.ScenesMONICA: You are not a freak. You're a guy.ScenesRACHEL: She's right. She's right. You are no different than the rest of them.ScenesMONICA: Wait a minute, wait a minute. Yes he is. You are totally different.ScenesCHANDLER: In a bad way?ScenesMONICA: No, honey, in a wonderful way. You know what you want now. Most guys don't even have a clue. You are ready to take risks, you are ready to be vulnerable, and intimate with someone.ScenesRACHEL: Yeah. You're not gonna end up alone.ScenesPHOEBE: Chandler, you called Janice! That's how much you wanted to be with someone!ScenesMONICA: You made it!ScenesPHOEBE: You're there!ScenesRACHEL: You are ready to make a commitment!ScenesCHANDLER: Whoa! Don't know about that.ScenesRACHEL: What you got there? Something else that's not yours that you can break?ScenesMONICA: No. Um, I know you like this, and I want you to have it. I think it'll look good in our apartment.ScenesRACHEL: Thank you.ScenesMONICA: That's fine.ScenesCHANDLER: Hey. Well, you will all be pleased to know that I have a date tomorrow night. This woman, Alison, from work. She's great. She's pretty, she's smart. And uh, I've been holding off on asking her out in the past, because she has an unusually large head. But, I'm not gonna let that stuff hang me up anymore. Look at me. I'm growing.ScenesJOEY: Hey, uh, you can't recycle yearbooks, can you?ScenesCHANDLER: I'll take that.ScenesJOEY: You want his yearbook?ScenesCHANDLER: Yeah, yeah. Some people said some nice things about him. I think somebody should have it.ScenesMONICA: Oh, gosh, this is so weird. I mean, his whole life was in this apartment, and now it's gone. You know, I think it would be nice if we just took a few moments, for Mr. Heckles. I mean, he was kind of a pain, he was, but, he was a person. You're all going to hell.ScenesRACHEL: It's really not that big!ScenesCHANDLER: Takin' that with you, huh?ScenesJOEY: Oh, yeah.ScenesROSS: You comin'?ScenesCHANDLER: Yeah, jus' second. Good-bye Mr. Heckles. We'll try to keep it down.ScenesALISON: Oh, my major was totally useless. I mean, how often do you look in the classifieds and see \"Philosopher wanted\"?ScenesCHANDLER: Sure. (My god, that's a big head! It didn't look this big in the office. Maybe it's the lighting. My head must look like a golf ball at work. All right, don't get hung up on it, quick, quick, list five things you like about her: Nice smile, good dresser...Big head, big head, big head!)ScenesENDScenesContrl08.gif (14783 bytes)ScenesThe One With Phoebe's HusbandScenesOriginally written by Alexa JungeScenesTranscribed by Josh Hodge.

My god, Rodrigo never gets pinned.Scenes(MACHINE--JOEY'S VOICE): Here comes the beep, you know what to do.ScenesJADE: Hello, I'm looking for Bob. This is Jane. I don't know if you're still at this number, but I was just thinking about us, and how great it was, and, well, I know it's been three years, but, I was kinda hoping we could hook up again. I barely had t he nerve to make this call, so you know what I did?ScenesCHANDLER: What?ScenesJADE: I got a little drunk...and naked.ScenesCHANDLER: Bob here.ScenesCHANDLER: (on phone) What've you been up to?ScenesJADE: Oh, you know, the usual, teaching aerobics, partying way too much. Oh, and in case you were wondering, those are my legs on the new James Bond poster.ScenesCHANDLER: Can you hold on a moment? I have another call. (to Ross) I love her.ScenesROSS: I know.ScenesCHANDLER: I'm back.ScenesJADE: So, are we gonna get together or what?ScenesCHANDLER: Um, absolutely. Uh, how 'bout tomorrow afternoon? Do you know uh, Central Perk in the Village, say, five-ish?ScenesJADE: Great, I'll see you then.ScenesCHANDLER: Ok. Ok. Having a phone has finally paid off.ScenesROSS: Even though you do do a good Bob impression, I'm thinkin' when she sees you tomorow, she's probably gonna realize, \"hey, you're not Bob.ScenesCHANDLER: I'm hoping that when Bob doesn't show up, she will seek comfort in the open arms of the wry stranger at the next table.ScenesROSS: Oh my god. You are pure evil.ScenesCHANDLER: Ok, pure evil, horny and alone. I've done this.Scenes(At Monica and Rachel's)ScenesROSS: (on phone) Yeah, yeah, everybody's here. Hey, everybody, say hi to Julie in New Mexico.ScenesALL: Hi, Julie!ScenesRACHEL: (sarcastically) Hi, Julie.ScenesCHANDLER: Ok, while Ross is on the phone, everybody owes me 62 bucks for his birthday.ScenesPHOEBE: Um, is, is there any chance that you're rounding up? You know, like from, like 20?ScenesCHANDLER: Hey, come on, we got the gift, the concert, and the cake.ScenesJOEY: Do we need a cake?ScenesCHANDLER: Look guys, I know it's a little steep.ScenesRACHEL: Yeah, whoosh!ScenesCHANDLER: But it's Ross.ScenesPHOEBE: It's Ross.ScenesJOEY: All right.ScenesCHANDLER: I'll see you guys later, I gotta go...do a thing.ScenesROSS: Ok, sweetheart, I'll call you later tonight. Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, hey, you're not really gonna go through with this, are you?ScenesCHANDLER: You know, I think I might just.ScenesRACHEL: So uh, what are you guys doing for dinner tonight?ScenesJOEY: Well I guess I gotta start savin' up for Ross's birthday, so I guess I'll just stay home and eat dust bunnies.ScenesPHOEBE: Can you believe how much this is gonna cost?ScenesRACHEL: Do you guys ever get the feeling that um, Chandler and those guys just don't get that we don't make as much money as they do?ScenesJOEY: Yes! Yeah, it's like they're always saying \"let's go here, let's go there\". Like we can afford to go here and there.ScenesPHOEBE: Yes, yes, and it's, and we always have to go to, you know, someplace nice, you know? God, and it's not like we can say anything about it, 'cause, like this birthday thing, it's for Ross.ScenesJOEY: For Ross.ScenesRACHEL: For Ross, Ross, Ross.ScenesMONICA: (enters) Oh my god.ScenesRACHEL: Hey.ScenesJOEY: Hi.ScenesRACHEL: What?ScenesMONICA: I'm at work, ordinary day, you know, chop chop chop, sauti, sauti, sauti. All of a sudden, Leon, the manager, calls me into his office. It turns out they fired the head lunch chef, and guess who got the job.ScenesJOEY: If it's not you, this is a horrible story.ScenesMONICA: Fortunately, it is me. And, they made me head of purchasing, thank you very much. Anyway, I just ran into Ross and Chandler downstairs, and they think we should go out and celebrate. You know, someplace nice.ScenesJOEY: Yeah, someplace nice. (to Phoebe and Rachel) How much do you think I can get for my kidney? (at Central Perk)ScenesROSS: I'm tellin' you. You can't do this.ScenesCHANDLER: Oh, come on. I can never get a girl like that with conventional methods.ScenesROSS: That doesn't matter. She wanted to call Bob. Hey, for all we know, Bob is who she was meant to be with. You may be destroying two people's chance for happiness.ScenesCHANDLER: We don't know Bob, ok? We know me. We like me. Please let me be happy.ScenesROSS: Go over there and tell that woman the truth.ScenesCHANDLER: All right.ScenesROSS: Go.ScenesCHANDLER: Hi.ScenesJADE: Hi.ScenesCHANDLER: Listen, I have to, uh, um, I have to, I have to confess something.ScenesJADE: Yes?ScenesCHANDLER: Whoever stood you up is a jerk.ScenesJADE: How did you--?ScenesCHANDLER: I don't know. I just had this weird sense. You know, but that's me. I'm weird and sensitive. Tissue?ScenesJADE: Thanks.ScenesCHANDLER: No, you keep the pack. I'm all cried out today.Scenes(At Somplace Nice)ScenesROSS: Ok, ok, here is to my sister, the newly-appointed head lunch chef--ScenesMONICA: Who is also in charge of purchasing.ScenesROSS: Newly appointed head lunch chef who is also in charge of purchasing--ScenesMONICA: Who has her own little desk when Roland's not there.ScenesROSS: Uh, lunch chef, purchasing, own little desk when Roland's not there. Here's to my little sister--ScenesMONICA: Oh, wait, and I got a beeper!ScenesJOEY: Cool.ScenesPHOEBE: Let's see!ScenesROSS: That's fine, I'll just wait!ScenesMONICA: Oh, sorry.ScenesJOEY: Sorry, sorry.ScenesROSS: Monica!Scenes(glasses clinking)ScenesWAITER: Are we ready to order?ScenesRACHEL: Oh, you know what, we haven't even looked yet.ScenesWAITER: Well, when you do, just let me know. I'll be right over there on the edge of my seat.ScenesPHOEBE: Wow, look at these prices.ScenesRACHEL: Yeah, these are pretty ch-ching.ScenesJOEY: What are these, like famous chickens?ScenesCHANDLER: Hey, sorry I'm late. Congratulations, Mon. (to Ross) I'm not sorry I'm late. How incredible was my afternoon with Jade?ScenesROSS: Well, pretty incredible according to the message she left you on my machine. Hey, Chandler, why is this woman leaving a message for you on my machine?ScenesCHANDLER: Oh, see, I had to tell her that my number was your number, because I couldn't tell her that my number was my number because she thinks that my number is Bob's number.ScenesROSS: Hey, tell me again, what do I do when Mr. Roper calls?ScenesWAITER: Do I dare ask?ScenesMONICA: Yes, I will start with the carpaccio, and then I'll have the grilled prawns.ScenesROSS: That sounds great. Same for me.ScenesWAITER: And for the gentleman?ScenesJOEY: Yeah, I'll have the Thai chicken pizza. But, hey, look, if I get it without the nuts and leeks and stuff, is it cheaper?ScenesWAITER: You'd think, wouldn't you? Miss?ScenesRACHEL: Ok, I will have the uh, (whispers) side salad.ScenesWAITER: (whispers) And what will that be on the side of?ScenesRACHEL: Uh, I don't know. Why don't you put it right here next to my water?ScenesWAITER: And for you?ScenesPHOEBE: Um, I'm gonna have a cup of the cucumber soup, and, um, take care.ScenesCHANDLER: I will have the uh, Cajun catfish.ScenesWAITER: Anything else?ScenesCHANDLER: Yes, how 'bout a verse of Killing Me Softly. You're gonna sneeze on my fish, aren't you?ScenesROSS: (using calculator) Plus tip, divided by six. Ok, everyone owes 28 bucks.ScenesRACHEL: Um, everyone?ScenesROSS: Oh, you're right, I'm sorry.ScenesJOEY: Thank you.ScenesROSS: Monica's big night, she shouldn't pay.ScenesMONICA: Oh, thank you!ScenesROSS: So five of us is, $33.50 apiece.ScenesPHOEBE: No, huh uh, no way, I'm sorry, not gonna happen.ScenesCHANDLER: Whoa, whoa, prom night flashback.ScenesPHOEBE: I'm sorry, Monica, I'm really happy you got promoted, but cold cucumber mush for thirty-something bucks? No! Rachel just had that, that, that salad, and, and Joey with his like teeny pizza! It's just...ScenesROSS: Ok, Pheebs! How 'bout we'll each just pay for what we had. It's no big deal.ScenesPHOEBE: Not for you.ScenesMONICA: All right, what's goin' on?ScenesRACHEL: Ok, look you guys, I really don't want to get into this right now. I think it'll just make everyone uncomfortable.ScenesPHOEBE: Fine. All right, fine.ScenesJOEY: Yeah.ScenesCHANDLER: You can tell us.ScenesROSS: Hello, it's us, all right? It'll be fine.ScenesJOEY: Ok, um, uh, we three feel like, that uh, sometimes you guys don't get that uh, we don't have as much money as you.ScenesMONICA: Ok.ScenesROSS: I hear ya.ScenesCHANDLER: We can talk about that.ScenesPHOEBE: Well, then...Let's.ScenesROSS: I, I just never think of money as an issue.ScenesRACHEL: That's 'cause you have it.ScenesROSS: That's a good point.ScenesCHANDLER: So um, how come you guys haven't talked about this before?ScenesJOEY: 'Cause it's always somethin', you know, like Monica's new job, or the whole Ross's birthday hoopla.ScenesROSS: Wha--? Whoa, hey, I don't want my birthday to be the source of any kind of negative--there's gonna be a hoopla?ScenesRACHEL: Basically, there's the thing, and then there's the stuff after the thing.ScenesMONICA: If it makes anybody feel better, then we can just forget the thing, and we'll just do the gift.ScenesROSS: G-gift? The thing's not the gift?ScenesCHANDLER: No, the thing was, we were gonna go see Hootie and the Blowfish.ScenesROSS: Hootie and the--oh my. I, I can catch them on the radio.ScenesPHOEBE: No, now I feel bad. You wanna go to the concert.ScenesROSS: No, look, hey, it's my birthday, and the important thing is that we all be together.ScenesMONICA: All of us.ScenesCHANDLER: Together.ScenesROSS: Not at the concert.ScenesRACHEL: Ok.ScenesJOEY: Yeah.ScenesRACHEL: Thank you.ScenesJOEY: Thanks.ScenesPHOEBE: Yeah.ScenesCHANDLER: So, the ebola virus. That's gotta suck, huh?Scenes(at Monica and Rachel's)ScenesCHANDLER: Gee, Monica, what's in the bag?ScenesMONICA: I don't know, Chandler. Let's take a look.ScenesPHOEBE: Oh, it's like a skit.ScenesMONICA: Why, it's dinner for six. 5 steaks, and an eggplant for Phoebe.ScenesROSS: Whoo!ScenesPHOEBE: Cool.ScenesMONICA: Yeah, we switched meat suppliers at work, and the new guys gave me the steaks as sort of a thank-you.ScenesROSS: But wait, there's more. Hey, Chandler, what is in the envelope?ScenesCHANDLER: By the way, this didn't seem so dorky in the hall.ScenesROSS: Come on.ScenesCHANDLER: Why, it's six tickets to Hootie and the Blowfish! The Blowfish!ScenesMONICA: It's on us, all right, so don't worry. It's our treat.ScenesPHOEBE: So...Thank you.ScenesROSS: Could you be less enthused?ScenesJOEY: Look, it's a nice gesture, it is. But it just feels like--ScenesMONICA: Like?ScenesJOEY: Charity.ScenesMONICA: Charity?ScenesROSS: We're just tryin' to do a nice thing here.ScenesRACHEL: Ross, you have to understand that your nice thing makes us feel this big.ScenesPHOEBE: Actually, it makes us feel that big.ScenesROSS: I don't, I don't understand. I mean, you, it's like we can't win with you guys.ScenesCHANDLER: If you guys feel this big, maybe that's not our fault. Maybe that's just how you feel.ScenesJOEY: Oh, now you're tellin' us how you feel.ScenesRACHEL: Ok, we never shoulda talked about this.ScenesPHOEBE: I'm just gonna pass on the concert, 'cause I'm just not in a very Hootie place right now.ScenesRACHEL: Me neither.ScenesJOEY: Me too.ScenesMONICA: Guys, we bought the tickets.ScenesPHOEBE: Oh, well, then you'll have extra seats, you know, for all your tiaras and stuff.ScenesCHANDLER: Why did you look at me when you said that?ScenesMONICA: Well, I guess now we can't go.ScenesRACHEL: What? Come on, you do what you want to do. Do we always have to do everything together?ScenesMONICA: You know what? You're right.ScenesPHOEBE: Fine.ScenesROSS: Fine.ScenesJOEY: Fine.ScenesCHANDLER: Fine.ScenesRACHEL: Fine.ScenesMONICA: All right. We're gonna go. It's not for another six hours. We're gonna go then.ScenesROSS: Chandler!ScenesCHANDLER: Yeah?ScenesROSS: Geez! Are you ready?ScenesCHANDLER: Yeah. Just let me grab my jacket and tell you I had sex today.ScenesROSS: Whoa! You had sex today?ScenesCHANDLER: Wow, it sounds even cooler when somebody else says it. I was awesome, ok? She was biting her lip to stop from screaming.ScenesROSS: Wow.ScenesCHANDLER: Now I know it's been awhile, but I took it as a good sign.Scenes(phone rings)ScenesROSS: Still doing the screening thing?ScenesCHANDLER: I had sex today. I never have to answer that phone again.ScenesMACHINE: Here comes the beep, you know what to do.ScenesJADE: Hey, Bob, it's Jade. Listen, I just wanted to tell you that I was really hurt when you didn't show up the other day, and just so you know, I ended up meeting a guy.ScenesCHANDLER: Bob here.ScenesJADE: Oh, hi.ScenesCHANDLER: So, uh, you met someone, huh?ScenesJADE: Yes, yes, I did. In fact, I had sex with him 2 hours ago.ScenesCHANDLER: So, uh, how was he?ScenesJADE: Eh.ScenesCHANDLER: Eh?ScenesJADE: Oh, Bob, he was nothing compared to you. I had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name.ScenesCHANDLER: Well, that makes me feel so good.ScenesJADE: It was just so awkward and bumpy.ScenesROSS: (silently mouthing) Bumpy?ScenesCHANDLER: Well, maybe he had some kind of uh, new, cool style, that you're not familiar with. And uh maybe you have to get used to it.ScenesJADE: Well there really wasn't much time to get used to it, you know what I mean?Scenes(at the concert)ScenesMONICA: You know what? I'm not gonna be able to enjoy this.ScenesROSS: Yeah, I know, it's my birthday. We all should be here.ScenesCHANDLER: So, let's go.ScenesROSS: Well maybe, you know, maybe we should stay for one song.ScenesCHANDLER: Yeah, I mean, it would be rude to them for us to leave now.ScenesMONICA: You know, the guys are probably having a great time.Scenes(at Monica and Rachel's)ScenesJOEY: Come on you guys, one more time.ScenesPHOEBE: Ok. One.ScenesJOEY: Nooo.ScenesMONICA: That was amazing!ScenesROSS: Excellent, that was excellent.ScenesCHANDLER: I can't believe the guys missed this.ScenesROSS: What guys?

How've you been?ScenesSTEVE: Good, good, I'm a lawyer now.ScenesMONICA: You can't be a lawyer. You're eight.ScenesSTEVE: Listen, it was nice to see you. I gotta run backstage.ScenesMONICA: Uh, wait, backstage?ScenesSTEVE: Oh, yeah, my firm represents the band.ScenesROSS: Ross.ScenesCHANDLER: Chandler.ScenesSTEVE: How are you? Look, you guys wanna meet the group? Come on. So, are you one of the ones who fooled around with my dad?Scenes(at Central Perk)ScenesROSS: Hey, you guys.ScenesRACHEL: Happy birthday.ScenesROSS: Oh, thank you, thanks. So uh, how was your night last night?ScenesRACHEL: Oh, well, it pretty much sucked. How was yours?ScenesMONICA: Yeah, ours pretty much sucked, oh, but, I did run into little Stevie Fisher. Remember him?ScenesRACHEL: Oh yeah. I used to babysit him. Hey, how's his dad?ScenesMONICA: Uh, good.ScenesROSS: Uh, aside from that, the whole evening was pretty much a bust.ScenesCHANDLER: Yeah, we really missed you guys.ScenesJOEY: Yeah, look, we were just saying, this whole thing is really stupid.ScenesPHOEBE: We just have to really, really, really, not let stuff like money get--is that a hickey?ScenesMONICA: No, I just, I fell down.ScenesRACHEL: On someone's lips? Where'd you get the hickey?ScenesMONICA: You know, a party, or--ScenesRACHEL: What party?ScenesROSS: It wasn't so much a party as...a gathering of people, with food, and music, and, and the band.ScenesJOEY: You partied with Hootie and the Blowfish?ScenesCHANDLER: Yes, apparently Stevie and the band are like this.ScenesRACHEL: Who gave you that hickey?ScenesMONICA: That would be the work of a Blowfish.ScenesRACHEL: Oh!ScenesPHOEBE: Oh! I can't believe it. I can't believe this. We're just like, sitting at home, trying to guess Joey's fingers, and you guys are out like partying and having fun, and you know, all, \"hey, Blowfish, suck on my neck\".ScenesROSS: Look, don't blame us. You guys coulda been there, you know.ScenesRACHEL: What, as part of your poor friends outreach program?Scenes(Monica's pager goes off)ScenesMONICA: It's work.ScenesCHANDLER: I don't know what to say. I'm sorry that we make more money than you. But we're not gonna feel guilty about it. We work really hard for it.ScenesJOEY: And we don't work hard?ScenesMONICA: (on phone) Yeah, hi, it's Monica. I just got a page.ScenesCHANDLER: I'm just saying that sometimes we like to do stuff that costs a little more.ScenesJOEY: And you feel like we hold you back.ScenesCHANDLER: Yes.ScenesRACHEL: Oh!ScenesCHANDLER: No.ScenesMONICA: Leon, Leon. Shhh! Guys. Wait, I don't understand. Those steaks were just a gift from the meat vendor. That was not a kick back. I'll just replace them and we can forget the whole thing. What corporate policy? No. Yeah. All right. I just got fired.ScenesPHOEBE: Oh.Scenes(Everyone goes over to comfort Monica)ScenesWAITRESS: Here's your check. That'll be $4.12.ScenesJOEY: Let me get that. (to Chandler) You got five bucks?ScenesMACHINE: Here comes the beep, you know what to do.ScenesJADE: Hi, it's me. Listen, Bob. I'm probably way out of line here.

La la la la la la la....ScenesROSS: Well, there's no way I'm gonna get a shot. Maybe they can take the needle and thquirt it into my mouth, you know, like a thquirt gun. ScenesDOCTOR: Hello, there. I'm Dr. Carlin. I see someone's having an allergic reaction.ScenesMONICA: Doctor, can I see you for just a minute please? My brother has a slight phobia about needles.ScenesROSS: Did you tell him about my thquirt gun idea?ScenesMONICA: My brother, the PhD would like to know if there's any way to treat this orally.

I mean, when I was little, everybody's parents were getting divorced.

I mean, she's doing it because she wants to be more like you.ScenesRACHEL: Well, then, you know, couldn't she have just copied my haircut?ScenesCHANDLER: You know, it's funny when my parents got divorced, they sent me to this shrink, and she told me that all kids have a tendency to blame themselves. But in your case it's actually kinda true.ScenesPHOEBE: That's him.ScenesCHANDLER: Damn. My mail order grandfather hasn't come yet.ScenesMR A: Phoebe?ScenesPHOEBE: Yes, hi, Mr. Adelman. Thanks for meeting me.ScenesMR A: Oh, that's all right, although you did cut into my busy day of sitting.ScenesPHOEBE: Um, do you wanna sit?ScenesMR A: Oh, no, please, I spent most of mid-morning trying to stand up. Now uh, what can I do for you, my dear?ScenesPHOEBE: I don't know how to say this, but I think when your wife's spirit left her body, it um, kind of stuck around in me.ScenesMR A: You're saying, my wife is in you?ScenesPHOEBE: Yeah. Ok, you don't have to believe me but um, can you think of any unfinished business she might have had, like any reason she'd be hanging around?ScenesMR A: Well, I don't know what to tell you dear. The only thing I can think of is that she always used to say that before she died, she wanted to see everything.ScenesPHOEBE: Everything?ScenesMR A: Everything.ScenesPHOEBE: Whoa, that's a lot of stuff.ScenesMR A: Oh, wait, I remember, she also said she wanted to sleep with me one last time.ScenesPHOEBE: I'm sorry, there's laughing in my head.ScenesMR A: [to Joey] Worth a shot, huh?Scenes[Joey nods and shrugs.]ScenesMRS GREEN: Look at this.ScenesRACHEL: These are from Halloween three years ago.ScenesMRS GREEN: Oh, look, here's Barry.

See, he's actually an orthodontist, but he came as a regular dentist.ScenesMONICA: Um, you guys, you know when I said before, \"thank you, but I don't really need your help\"?ScenesRACHEL: Actually, what I think you said was, \"don't touch that, and get the hell out of my kitchen.ScenesMONICA: Really? Weird. Anyway, see, I planned everything really well. I planned and I planned and I planned. It just turns out, I don't think I planned enough time to actually do it.ScenesRACHEL: Hey, Mon, you want some help?ScenesMONICA: If you want.ScenesPHOEBE: [enters] Hey. What a day. I took her everywhere. The Museum of Modern Art, Rockefeller Center, Statue of Liberty.ScenesRACHEL: She's still with you?ScenesPHOEBE: Yeah. I guess she hasn't seen everything yet.

Does anybody have any marijuana?ScenesRACHEL: God!ScenesMONICA: All right, look, nobody's smoking pot around all this food.ScenesMRS GREEN: That's fine. I never did it. I just thought I might. So, what's new in sex?ScenesRACHEL: Oh! What's new in sex?ScenesMRS GREEN: The only man I've ever been with is your father.ScenesMONICA: I'm dicing, I'm dicing, I don't hear anything.ScenesMRS GREEN: I mean, this is no offense to your dad, sweetie, but I was thinking there might be more.ScenesRACHEL: Oh, I'm sorry. You know what? I cannot have this conversation with you. I mean, god, you just come in here, and drop this bomb on me, before you even tell Daddy. What? What do you want? Do you want my blessing?ScenesMRS GREEN: No.ScenesRACHEL: You want me to talk you out of it?ScenesMRS GREEN: No.ScenesRACHEL: Then what?

No sir!ScenesMONICA: [to Ross] All right, you!ScenesROSS: No. Look, I told you I am not a part of this thing.ScenesMONICA: All right, look, Ross. I realize that you have issues with Carol and Susan, and I feel for you, I do. But if you don't help me cook, I'm gonna take a bunch of those little hot dogs, and I'm gonna create a new appetizer called \"pigs in Ross\". All right, ball the melon.ScenesCHANDLER: Hey!

Got my little happy helpers.[everyone groans]ScenesCAROL: Fine, whatever.ScenesROSS: What's the matter?ScenesCAROL: Nothing. Ok, everything. I think we're calling off the wedding.ScenesROSS: What?ScenesMONICA: You're still gonna pay me, right? Or something a little less selfish.ScenesROSS: Carol, what's the matter? What happened?ScenesCAROL: My parents called this afternoon to say they weren't coming.ScenesROSS: Oh my god.ScenesCAROL: I mean, I knew they were having trouble with this whole thing, but they're my parents. They're supposed to give me away and everything.ScenesROSS: It's ok. I'm sorry.ScenesCAROL: And then Susan and I got in this big fight because I said maybe we should call off the wedding, and she said we weren't doing it for them, we were doing it for us, and if I couldn't see that, then maybe we should call off the wedding. I don't know what to do.ScenesROSS: I uh can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I think Susan's right.ScenesCAROL: You do?ScenesROSS: Look, do you love her? And you don't have to be too emphatic about this.ScenesCAROL: Of course I do.ScenesROSS: Well then that's it. And if George and Adelaide can't accept that, then the hell with them. Look, if my parents didn't want me to marry you, no way that would have stopped me. Look, this is your wedding. Do it.ScenesCAROL: You're right. Of course you're right.ScenesMONICA: So we're back on?ScenesCAROL: We're back on.ScenesMONICA: You heard the woman. Peel, chop, devil!
