Neither you can come to the party!ScenesChandler: Jeez, what a baby.ScenesJoey: Yeah, Ross, way to ruin it. I was just going to get dressed.ScenesRoss: You know what I don't care. The only person I cared about getting dressed, is the one person that says she's not even gonna go. Look Rach, I'm sorry. Okay. Look, I-I wa, I was a jerk. I'm sorry I yelled. I want you there, I need you there.
