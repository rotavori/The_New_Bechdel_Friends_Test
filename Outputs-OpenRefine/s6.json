Especially Ross.Scenes[Ross glares at Monica.]Scenes[Everyone takes a bite of their trifle.]ScenesAll: (faking enjoyment) Mmm.ScenesChandler: (clearly lying and hating the dessert) Yeah, this is so good, that I’m gonna go enjoy it on the balcony so that I can enjoy the view whilst I enjoy my dessert.Scenes[Chandler exits to the balcony.]ScenesMrs. Geller: (lying) I’ve gotta call my friend Mary and tell her how good this is, from Monica’s room.ScenesMr. Geller: (also lying) I’ll help you dial.Scenes[Jack and Judy exit to Monica’s room.]ScenesMonica: (again, lying) I’m gonna go into the bathroom so I can look at it in the mirror, as I eat it.Scenes[Monica exits to the bathroom.]ScenesRachel: Okay, now what was that all about?

It was soo cool! Then, he took me diving and he introduced me to his pet seahorse, who, by the way, was totally coming on to me, and please, that is not gonna happen.Scenes[Jack and Judy come out of Monica’s room and sit down on the couch.]ScenesMr. Geller: Boy, I’m glad I wore the big belt today.ScenesPhoebe: Five minutes ago, a line like that would’ve floored me.

Alright Joey, if wanna leave, just leave. Rachel, no you weren’t supposed to put beef in the trifle. It did not taste good. Phoebe, I’m sorry, but I think Jacques Cousteau is dead.

Monica, why you felt you had to hide the fact that you were in an important relationship is beyond me.ScenesMr. Geller: And we kinda figured about the porch swing.ScenesMrs. Geller: Ross, drugs? Divorced? Again?ScenesMr. Geller: What happened son?ScenesRoss: I-I uh, I got tricked into all those things!ScenesMrs. Geller: Chandler! You’ve been Ross’s best friend all these years, stuck by him during the drug problems. (Ross gets disgusted.) And now you’ve taken on Monica as well. Well, I don’t know what to say.

Oh no! These credits are based on the world that would have been created had all of the above actually happened.

It then goes on to show Rachel’s still a shop-aholic and with Barry. Fat Monica is sweating while cooking and dancing while eating a donut. Phoebe as the Wall Street shark smoking while on two cell phones. Then they’re dancing in the fountain. Joey entering as Dr. Drake Remoray and meeting a groupie. Chandler trying to write as a bird does its business on his shoulder and falling asleep while typing. Ross doing some kara-tay and trying to get Carol into bed. And finally, some more dancing in the fountain, them all flexing, and the turning out the lamp and shutting off all the lights bit from the first season. Just remember one thing, this is an alternate universe. Everything from every other episode doesn’t apply, for instance, Ross and Rachel have no history.

Talking about pig sex over lunch, I don’t want that!ScenesRichard: I think that’s fair.ScenesMonica: Fair? Please don’t even talk to me about fair! Fair would’ve been you wanting to marry me back then! Or fair would’ve been Chandler wanting to marry me now! Believe me, nothing about this is fair! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!ScenesRichard: It’s okay! Shh! Hey. Hey. (Hugs her) Shhhh.ScenesMonica: Nothing.

I love her!ScenesRichard: Well, apparently I’m willing to offer her things that you are not.ScenesChandler: But I am willing to offer her all those things. This was just a plan, y’know? A way to throw her off course so that when I offered her all these things, she’d be surprised!ScenesRichard: Well if it helps, it worked very well.ScenesChandler: It was working until you showed up, you big tree! I mean, this isn’t fair. You had your chance with her! You had your chance and you blew it! And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other!
