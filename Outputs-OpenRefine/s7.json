Oh, the things she must have seen! And then she climbed up the fire escape and she tapped on the window with her teeny little paw and then we ran to let her in…(Realizes, that Chandler starts to not believing her) I went to far, didn't I? When should I have stopped?Scenes[Time lapse, after dinner. Ross stands up from his self-made map.]ScenesRoss: Okay, maybe this is so hard, because there aren't 50 states. Let me tell you something, I have 49 states, and there are no more! I-I think, I should be able to eat something.ScenesChandler: It's up to you.Scenes[Ross whines and starts working again.

(Walks back to his map dejectedly.)Scenes[Rachel and Tag go into the hall.]ScenesRachel: Look, um, I think we should talk about what happened on the terrace.ScenesTag: Okay.ScenesRachel: Ah, I-I never should have said what I said. It—y’know what? It just doesn't matter how I feel. I mean we work together, so nothing could really ever happen between us, and what I would love is just to go to work on Monday, and-and never talk about this again, okay? Big day Monday lots to do. So, we're okay?ScenesTag: Um, I'm not.ScenesRachel: Oh, god, I know it, that I freaked you out.ScenesTag: No, you didn't. The only thing that freaked me out was you saying that nothing could ever happen between us.ScenesRachel: Really?ScenesTag: Yeah, so, please don't fire me for doing this.

It’s a tradition left over from Porsche’s racing history. The world’s greatest endurance race is the 24 Hours of LeMans. Which is in France and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on Saturday through the dark of night and finishes at noon on Sunday.  In the 60s LeMans had a unique start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the track. At the start of the race, the drivers would run across the track, get in the car, buckle up, start the car, and drive off. Porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that took. Since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the steering wheel, that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat-belts, put the car in gear and start it. The driver’s left hand did nothing. Porsche in order to save a few seconds in a 24-hour race; moved the ignition switches to the left side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while grabbing the seat-belts with his right hand. That’s why every Porsche car built since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel.}ScenesRoss: No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! (She starts the car.) Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now! (He looks for the twenty Rachel stole and doesn’t find it.)ScenesRachel: Look Ross, if you’re so freaked out, just get in the car!ScenesRoss: With you?! Yeah right!ScenesRachel: All right. (She starts off.)ScenesRoss: (grabbing the car) Okay! Okay! Okay! (He gets in, but into the back seat.)ScenesRachel: What are you doing?!

Why?!ScenesRachel: Because! Because I was sad.ScenesMonica: What do you mean?ScenesRachel: Look, I am so…so happy for you guys, but you getting married just reminds me of the fact that I’m not.

So why don’t you just hand over the keys?ScenesRachel: Oh.Scenes{Transcriber’s Note: She puts the key into the ignition, which is on the left side of the steering wheel. Does anyone know why that is? It’s a tradition left over from Porsche’s racing history. The world’s greatest endurance race is the 24 Hours of LeMans. Which is in France and runs for 24 hours straight from noon on Saturday through the dark of night and finishes at noon on Sunday.  In the 60s LeMans had a unique start where the drivers would actually start the race outside of the car and across the track. At the start of the race, the drivers would run across the track, get in the car, buckle up, start the car, and drive off. Porsche wanted to reduce the amount of time that took. Since all cars to that point had the ignition switches on the right side of the steering wheel, that required the drivers to use their right hand to grab the seat-belts, put the car in gear and start it. The driver’s left hand did nothing. Porsche in order to save a few seconds in a 24-hour race; moved the ignition switches to the left side of the steering wheel so that the driver could start the car with his left hand while grabbing the seat-belts with his right hand. That’s why every Porsche car built since then has the ignition on the left side of the steering wheel.}ScenesRoss: No ah-ah-ah! Do not start this car! (She starts the car.) Okay! Okay! I will give you twenty bucks if you get out of this car right now! (He looks for the twenty Rachel stole and doesn’t find it.)ScenesRachel: Look Ross, if you’re so freaked out, just get in the car!ScenesRoss: With you?! Yeah right!ScenesRachel: All right. (She starts off.)ScenesRoss: (grabbing the car) Okay! Okay! Okay! (He gets in, but into the back seat.)ScenesRachel: What are you doing?!
