I—Okay umm…this…I-I sent my friend Joey in here to find out stuff about you. Umm y’know, if it helps you came off great. A lot better than I’m coming off right now.ScenesCliff: I don’t believe this. You got him to pretend he was some fake doctor?ScenesJoey: Fake? Excuse me? Hello? (Taps the TV screen.)ScenesCliff: And then you tried to make me think that I was crazy.ScenesPhoebe: You’re right, that was wrong. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. It’s just that I liked you so much. Can we just, can we just start over?ScenesCliff: I don’t think so.ScenesJoey: Uh, if I may? Umm-umm look, Cliff, you told me a lot of personal stuff about you, right? And maybe-maybe it would if-if would help if-if you knew some personal stuff about her. Uh, she was married to a gay ice dancer. Uh, she gave birth to her brother’s triplets. Oh! Oh! Her-her twin sister used to do porn!ScenesPhoebe: Uh Joey, we’re trying to dial down the crazy.ScenesJoey: Right!ScenesPhoebe: Umm, look we don’t, we don’t really know each other so it would be really easy to just forget about this, but there seems to be something between us. And I don’t know about you but that doesn’t happen to me a lot.ScenesCliff: It doesn’t happen to me either.ScenesJoey: Me neither."
